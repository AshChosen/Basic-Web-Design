     <h1> Selling Yourself</h1>   
     <p>It's almost as if we play a character. It's as if that character changes based on thier experiences. How do we sell ourselves? We provide our services and exploit our tlents. Search for a way to find sustainability with your talents. For me it was my goal to find a job where I could use my skills with a camera as a way to fund not only my living expenses, but a way to reach for my dreams as well. </p>
